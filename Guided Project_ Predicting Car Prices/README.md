# Project: Optimize KNN model for prediction of cars' market price

## Introduction
This project aims at understanding fundamentals of machine learning using the k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Automobile data set is used for predicting car's market price from various attributes.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to optimize number of features and number of neighbors of the KNN models by mean of Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) minimization.

## Methodology
### Techonologies used
- Jupyter notebook (Python)
- Python libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Sklearn

## Key finding
The model optimization was done on a basis of RMSE minimization. The result shows that the best KNN model is the one with 3 features including engine-size, highway-mpg and curb-weight. The optimal k for this model is 2.
